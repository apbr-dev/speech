00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 I'm looking for you and I don't know where you are, I'm looking for answers

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 When was the last time I saw you smile?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 My queen used to tell you, her legs trembled

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 With you the nights were not to sleep

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Sometimes I ignore it, I smoke and drink alone

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 I always thought I shouldn't ask you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 I exchanged your money for gold, you were my treasure

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 I didn't know that one day you would forget about me

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 And, and, about me And, and, about you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 I didn't know that one dayyou would forget about me

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 And, and, about me And, and, about you

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 I didn't know that one day you would forget about me

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 And, and, about me And, and, about me

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 I didn't know that one day you would forget about me

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 And, and, about me And, and, about you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Yeah, yeah

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Sometimes I miss you, but I want to forgive you

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Baby, throw yourself at the canvas

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 You left my stamina at zero

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Don't call me when you feel alone

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Baby, I know you miss the cars too

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Being love when we were expensive

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Yeah

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Everything was a lie when you told me

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Baby, I miss you

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 That we would last for years

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Baby, it hurt, I deceive you

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 I hope this song is over

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 And I finally forget about you

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 I look for you and I don't know where you are

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 I've been looking for answers

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 When was the last time I saw you smile?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 I told my queen

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 My legs trembled

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 I didn't know that one day you would forget about me

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 And, and, about me And, and, about you

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 I didn't know that one day you would forget about me

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 And, and, about me And, and, about you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 I didn't know that one day you would forget about me

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 And, and, about me And, and, about me

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 I didn't know that one day you would forget about me

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 And, and, about me And, and, about you

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 I didn't know that one day you would forget about me

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Yeah, ah
