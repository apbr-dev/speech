00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 I'm looking for you and I don't know where you are, I'm looking for answers

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 When was the last time I saw you smile?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 My queen used to tell you, her legs trembled

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 With you the nights were not to sleep

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Sometimes I ignore it, I smoke and drink alone

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 I always thought I shouldn't ask you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 I exchanged your money for gold, you were my treasure

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 I didn't know that you forgot about me

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 About me and about you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 I didn't know that you forgot about me

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 About me and about you

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 I didn't know that you forgot about me

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 About me and about you

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 I didn't know that you forgot about me

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 About me and about you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Yeah, yeah

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Sometimes I miss you, but I want to forgive you

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Baby, you threw me into the mud

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 You left me with zero stamina

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Don't call me when you feel alone

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Baby, I know you miss the cars too

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Being the love when we were cheap

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Everything was a lie when you told me

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Baby, I miss you, that we would last for years

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Baby, it hurt, I deceive you

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 I hope this song is over

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 And I finally forget about you

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 I look for you and I don't know where you are

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 I've been looking for answers

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 When was the last time I saw you smile?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 I told my queen

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 My legs trembled

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 I didn't know that you forgot about me

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 About me and about you

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 I didn't know that you forgot about me

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 About me and about you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 I didn't know that you forgot about me

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 About me and about you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 I didn't know that you forgot about me

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 About me and about you

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 I didn't know that you forgot about me
